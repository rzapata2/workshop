## First Verse 
Little Birds are dining  
Warily and well,  
Hid in mossy cell:  
Hid, I say, by waiters  
Gorgeous in their gaiters  

## Second Verse
Whose woods these are I think I know.  
His house is in the village though;   
He will not see me stopping here  
To watch his woods fill up with snow.  
My little horse must think it queer  

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->

## Last Verse
Out of every hundred people,  
those who always know better:  
fifty-two.  

Unsure of every step:  
almost all the rest.  

Ready to help,  
if it doesn't take long:  
forty-nine.  

Always good,  
because they cannot be otherwise:  
four -- well, maybe five.
